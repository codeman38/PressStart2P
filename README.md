# Press Start 2P

Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco
arcade games. Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates
back to Atari's "Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType
conversion are based on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the
first games to include and regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase
letters in its screen font.

Unlike the original font from the "Return of Ishtar" ROM, Press Start 2P
includes a wide variety of non-ASCII Unicode characters for pan-European
use, including Greek and Cyrillic.
